Making a StarFinder text adventure. Based off the mechanics from StarFinder.

Pre-requisites:
- pytest
- Python 3

Context: 
I want some type of programming project to work on and iterate upon. Doing programming
problems only entertains for so long and does not teach real development, which 
is dependent on unit tests, integration tests, maintaining old code, and modularizing

Style:
I plan to do TDD. Basically make a suite of tests that will fail FIRST, then will 
succeed as soon as the functionality is in place. No fancy graphics to hold me back. 

Also, purely text, since why not. I may dabble with game engines as time goes on
but I don't have any want/need to make animations or fancy stuff. At least, not yet.
Basically focus on the purest form of a game. An interactive story and a yarn to tell


Some fun undocumented trends:
Stat blocks will have the order of:
STR
DEX
CON
INT
WIS
CHA

Need to keep that order in mind when integrating stats between Theme, race and class
