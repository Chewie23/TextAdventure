Gonna try to recreate the StarFinder mechanics in a Python game. And probably
use a SQLite3 to store relevant data (item, bestiary, etc)

This is so I can get up and running on Python again. And will most likely
start doing good practices and crap (unit tests, @property, OOP).


The big ol TODO list:
1) Figure out a good way to organize this.
    a) There will be a lot of moving parts, like test, classes, data, etc
    b) This, of course, assumes adherence to best practices
2) Start small. I say the mechanics of character creation. This means a lot of
things, but yeah
