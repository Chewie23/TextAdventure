Overarching plan:

Instead of spinning my wheels and creating an abstract character who can chooes
all of the classes/themes/races available (and the interplay between them), I 
think the best path forward is to make a proof of concept. 

Basically focus down to one class (Envoy), one theme (Ace Pilot) and one race 
(Android). Have that one specific instance of that character fight against someone
and level up. 

So in a nut shell:
1) Character sheet to handle
    a) Class + Theme + Race
2) A bestiary/monster class
3) XP/leveling up system
4) Story
    a) Mostly to decide what mechanics NOT to include
    
Again. Proof of concept. No more, no less. Otherwise will spin my wheels
without actually practicing what matters (code integration)

Maybe I should focus even more, and not even have feats. That way it's more 
traditional RPG. Or have custom ones? Seems like there is a lot of hidden 
questions I need to answer here
