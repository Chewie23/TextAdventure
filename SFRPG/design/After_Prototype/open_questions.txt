There are several open questions I would like to answer eventually. 

Not to be solved until after the prototype

1) How to make a map system?
    a) How to display or show?
2) How to make a save system?
3) Feats?
    a) to add feats or not to add feats?
4) Combat system?
5) Make a bank of feats?
    a) Would literally mean I would have to check for the relevant feats every
        single event. This may or may not be the answer. Maybe only focus on THAT
        particular instance of the character's abilities, and see if relevant?
6) How to store data? 
    a) In the program?
    b) Binary text file?
