Combat.

So, my plan is to have theater of the mind type of combat, since it's hard
to convey distance without visual aid. So that means movement and cover are
a little de-emphasized but still in play. 

The real question is how to involve movement in a text game? Because there isn't
any way to incorporate it without qualitative description. And that sound like
more of a hassle than I would like.

So my options:
1) Mention it only when it matters, thus all feats related to movements are 
pretty much nerfed or not valid
2) Keep it as a status in combat
    a) This could get messy, since tracking that many things? In a traditional
    text RPG, you are always within range. But that would definitely mean 
    movement is no longer a thing to consider in tactics
    
I guess combat should be simplified, for my sake. 

Movement will be base speed / 10 (floor). That gives several options of movement, 
such as "take cover", "flank", etc

There won't be a defend move, since it'll all be about moving around the field

Of course, the enemies can do it. So basically no real throw away enemies in this 
game. Which is gonna be interesting to program, but for now, the mechanics to draw upon

Summary:
1) Combat will have the following happen in one round:
    Initiative roll (during first round)
    a) Movement actions (will have a counter, which is base speed / 10, to nearest int)
        i) Cover (if available)
        ii) Flank
        iii) Withdraw
        iv) Run away
    b) Actions
        i) Attack
        ii) Heal
        iii) Special feats (maybe affect stuff)
    c) Bonus action (if applicable)
