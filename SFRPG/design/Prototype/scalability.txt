The question about scalability

The prototype is one build, with a a type of class, race, theme and thrown into
combat

This is interesting, since scalability should be considered. Otherwise, it goes
all out the window when trying to implement the entire system at once

So, in order to have scalability, I need to assume some things that aren't in 
place yet. Like a hook to tell when the character has a certain ability, or how
a specific feat only comes up in certain situations.

Not entirely sure how to handle this, but I get the feeling this is what this project
will teach me, one way or the other
