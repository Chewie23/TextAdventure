What comprises a StarFinder character:
1) Stats (STR, CON, etc)
2) HP, SP
3) AC
4) Modifiers
5) Race
6) Theme
7) Skills
8) Spells (if necessary)


So, I think to have modularized approach. If nothing else, to get practice in
inheritance and creating Python modules and such

The overall class that collates these parts would be the character sheet
Would hold the misc. stuff, like, name, age, weight, etc
