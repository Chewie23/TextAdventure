Combat.

So, my plan is to have theater of the mind type of combat, since it's hard
to convey distance without visual aid. So that means movement and cover are
a little de-emphasized but still in play. 

The real question is how to involve movement in a text game? Because there isn't
any way to incorporate it without qualitative description. And that sound like
more of a hassle than I would like.

So my options:
1) Mention it only when it matters, thus all feats related to movements are 
pretty much nerfed or not valid
2) Keep it as a status in combat
    a) This could get messy, since tracking that many things? In a traditional
    text RPG, you are always within range. But that would definitely mean 
    movement is no longer a thing to consider in tactics
