What comprises a StarFinder character:
1) Stats (STR, CON, etc)
2) HP, SP
3) AC
4) Modifiers
5) Race
6) Theme
7) Skills
8) Spells (if necessary)


So, I think to have modularized approach. If nothing else, to get practice in
inheritance and creating Python modules and such

The overall class that collates these parts would be the character sheet
Would hold the misc. stuff, like, name, age, weight, etc

The real question here is how to modularize the above. Each rely on each other to
some fashion, but the fundamental part is the stat block. That influences everything 
from what you can carry, do or say.


So, my initial idea is to have a stats block class that has various ways of being fed
(i.e. Race, Theme, anything that changes the core stat block). Then that propagates outwards
to the relevant parts of the character (HP, SP, modifiers, AC, etc)


The way I see all this coming together is having a master class for "character sheet" and 
the various things feed into that. Some classes will have sub-classes, of course, but 
all can feed into character sheet. For example racial feats or theme feats will be collated in the Feat() class, but 
other stuff from race/theme go where needed
