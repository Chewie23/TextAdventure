Taking a note out of Ben Croshaw's book of game design (basically first solve the 
major questions for this game in plain English, then code around that. Not the 
other way around)

So. The major questions:

1) What is the gameplay loop going to be about?
2) What are the mechanics?


The gameplay loop will be about exploring, fighting and leveling up. I like to make it on the
harder side where resources are scarce and every inch has to be fought for. Basically need to think
about the choices that affect now vs. the choices that affect later

The mechanics are literally StarFinder. Which saves me a bunch of work on figuring out a 
somewhat balanced system. The main question is now how to translate all Core Rule book into
something technically viable (and maintainable).
